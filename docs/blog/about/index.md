# About Me

I'm Eric Bouchut, a dedicated software developer with a deep passion for both coding and dancing.  
My expertise lies in *Ruby on Rails* and *Blockchain*.  
Additionally, I thrive on sharing knowledge and fostering growth.

With over 15 years in the software development industry, my journey spans a diverse array of roles:

- 6+ years as a **Ruby on Rails** and Java developer at *LD Mobile* (acquired by *S4M*, now [*Ask Locala*](https://asklocala.com/)), contributing to a mobile DSP in the Real-Time Bid sector for programmatic advertising. I also worked for [HostnFly](https://hostnfly.com/) as a Ruby on Rails and Java Developer.  
- 3 years as a **Web developer** using Java and GWT at [Antidot](https://www.antidot.net), a private search engine company. 
- 5 years of experience in Java and web development for 2 startups: *Perform* (acquired by BMC) and *Miyowa*. 
- Engaged in extensive **Java**-related projects, including a significant 7-year tenure at [BMC Software](https://www.bmc.com), a Fortune 500 company. 
- 3 years of Unix/C/C++ development at an IT consulting firm.
- Computer science **teacher** at *Axis Digital*, where I: 
	- Conducted 4 distinct training classes for groups of up to 15 individuals over a span of 3 years. 
	- Created and delivered a computer science course focused on advanced Unix usage, titled *'Utilisation Unix avancée"*. 
 
My commitment to professional growth led me to enroll in an online training program at [Alyra](https://alyra.fr), where I successfully graduated as a [*Blockchain and Smart Contracts Developer*](https://certificate.bcdiploma.com/check/8AEFB8EA0140B750A45B5C30C13E2F320F2D746A07337296DAB5FF4D23789757ZmlaRlRBZHB6NTJtVEdObFQ1RUt4MEllUFJQRVRGYWxnZEx4Qjl6QmF1Y2Y0Wkll).

Moreover, I'm actively engaged in the **open-source** community, contributing to the [**Loop**](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/) Open Source project. Specifically, I focus on enhancing the project's **technical documentation**, a critical aspect of ensuring its usability and accessibility. You can explore my contributions on the [LoopDocs](https://github.com/LoopKit/loopdocs) repository, where I collaborate with a diverse team distributed across geographical locations. My responsibilities involve improving product documentation and configuring seamless website development and publishing tools, leveraging technologies like *mkdocs* and *`mkdocs-material`*.

This open-source initiative aims to provide comprehensive resources for users of *Loop*—an advanced *Automated Insulin Delivery* system for individuals with diabetes.
