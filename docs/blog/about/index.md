# About Me

I'm Eric Bouchut, a dedicated software developer with a deep passion for both coding and dancing.  
My expertise lies in *Ruby on Rails* and *Blockchain*.  
Additionally, I thrive on sharing knowledge and fostering growth.

With over 15 years in the software development industry, my journey spans a diverse array of roles:

- **6+ years** as a **Ruby on Rails** and Java developer at *LD Mobile* (acquired by *S4M*, now [*Ask Locala*](https://asklocala.com/)), contributing to a mobile DSP in the Real-Time Bidding sector for programmatic advertising. I also worked at [HostnFly](https://hostnfly.com/) as a Ruby on Rails and Java Developer.  
- **3 years** as a **Web developer** using Java and GWT at [Antidot](https://www.antidot.net), a private search engine company. 
- **5 years** of experience in Java and web development for 2 startups: *Perform* (acquired by BMC) and *Miyowa*. 
- Engaged in extensive **Java**-related projects, including a significant 7-year tenure at [BMC Software](https://www.bmc.com), a Fortune 500 company. 
- **3 years** of Unix/C/C++ development at an IT consulting firm.
- Computer science **teacher** at *Axis Digital*, where I: 
	- Conducted four distinct training classes for groups of up to 15 individuals over **three years**. 
	- Designed and delivered a course on advanced Unix usage.
 
My commitment to **professional growth** led me to enroll in an online training program at [Alyra](https://alyra.fr), where I graduated as a [*Blockchain and Smart Contracts Developer*](https://certificate.bcdiploma.com/check/8AEFB8EA0140B750A45B5C30C13E2F320F2D746A07337296DAB5FF4D23789757ZmlaRlRBZHB6NTJtVEdObFQ1RUt4MEllUFJQRVRGYWxnZEx4Qjl6QmF1Y2Y0Wkll).

Moreover, I'm actively engaged in the **open-source** community, contributing to the [Loop](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/) and [Trio](https://docs.diy-trio.org/) open-source projects. Specifically, I focus on enhancing their **technical documentation**.  
You can explore my contributions in the [LoopDocs](https://github.com/LoopKit/loopdocs) and [TrioDocs](https://github.com/nightscout/trio-docs) repositories, where I collaborate in English with a diverse team distributed across various geographical locations.  
My responsibilities include improving product documentation as well as **configuring and maintaining website publishing platforms** leveraging technologies such as *[MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)* and [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

> This open-source initiative aims to provide comprehensive resources for users of *Loop* and *Trio*—advanced *Automated Insulin Delivery* systems for individuals with type 1 diabetes.

In 2024, I successfully completed a certified training program in **Cybersecurity Development** (POEC *Cybersecurity Developer*) and earned the **TOSA Python 3 certification**, strengthening my skills in secure coding and cybersecurity.
