> *Hugo* version keeps every `.js` and `.css` files untouched from original *Hexo* version in order to enjoy futur original *Hexo* version updates or features! 

That mean I would keep a stronge dependency with original *Hexo* theme. Thus if you want to suggest any modifications on `.css` or `.js` files **I will submit those changes to original *Hexo* theme** (except if it's really specific to *Hugo* bugs that is not present on *Hexo*).
