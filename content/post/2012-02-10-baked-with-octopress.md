I finally decided to make the move to [Octopress][].
<!--more-->

A lot has been said about this new blogging framework, 
since last year when I first read about it on [Hacker News][].
To know more about the reasons why I decided to switch 
my blog from Wordpress to  Octopress, you can read the posts 
by [Aijaz Ansari][], [Matt Gemmell][] and [Mark Nichols][].

I intend to use my blog to share my thoughts on all things related to programming.
I will also keep you apprised of what I have learned so far about tech 
and share with you blog posts and podcasts I find interesting.
